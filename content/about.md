I stumbled upon Dart last year, no, not through Flutter, but though AngularDart. While I did not end up selecting AngularDart for the project, I fell in love with the language, and decided to learn it and use it; I never looked back.

I do not use Dart in my day to day job, I wish I did, but I don't. But that does not stop me from using it. Flutter may have boosted Dart's popularity recently but it by no means is limited to it, it can be more. It can be a very educational first programming language, it can be a very fun full-stack language, it can be a language to implement algorithms or solving programming challenges. I intend to log all my efforts in all those things into this site.

My knowledge is by no means authoritative. I just wish to share whatever I gather in my day to day Dartfulness with a hope that someone corrects my ways. There are numerous sites, blogs or tutorials dedicated to Flutter, but not enough dedicated solely on Dart (Even less so on AngularDart). `dartful.dev` would be an attempt to fill that that gap, even if by very little.

So what do I plan to write here? First and foremost, this site focuses on "vanilla" Dart. I would explore various areas of programming from a Dartistic point of view, it may seem random but will manage `tags` so that they can be categorized and read in sequence. I have not figured anything solid out yet but from top of my head, I would write about general programming concepts, algorithms and data structure implementations, design patterns and full-stack web development. I don't think there will be many (if any) Flutter materials here, but I believe a solid knowledge of Dart makes the Flutter experience much smoother.

I am grateful to the Google's Dart Team and the contributors for constructing such a simple yet pragmatic language, and the Dart community for staying with it and enriching it through its highs and lows. I would like to thank them all and if this site ever helps anyone in anything, all credits will go to them.

So now that the introduction has been made, I am going to throw a lot of Darts in this site and I know I'll enjoy the journey.
