I decided to start Dart last year, not through Flutter, but through AngularDart. While I did not end up selecting AngularDart for the project, I fell in love with the language, and decided to learn it more and use it; I never looked back.

I do not use Dart at my day job, I wish I did, but I don't. But that doesn't stop me from using it. Flutter may have boosted Dart's popularity recently but it by no means is limited to it, it can be more. It can be a very educational first programming language, it can be a very fun full-stack language, it can be a language to implement algorithms or solving programming challenges. I intend to log my efforts in all these in here.

My knowledge is by no means authoritative. I just wish to share whatever I gather in my day to day Dartfulness with a hope that someone corrects my ways. There are numerous sites, blogs or tutorials dedicated to Flutter, but not enough dedicated solely to Dart (Even less so in case of AngularDart). `dartful.dev` would be an attempt to fill those gaps, even if by very little.

So what do I plan to write here? First and foremost, this site focuses on mainly "vanilla" Dart and occasionally AngularDart. I would explore various areas of programming from a Dartistic point of view, it may seem random but will manage `tags` so that they can be categorized and read in sequence. I have not figured any solid layout yet but from top of my head, I would write about *general programming concepts*, *algorithms and data structure* implementations, *design patterns* and *full-stack web development*. I don't think there will be many (if any) Flutter materials here, but I believe a solid knowledge of Dart makes the Flutter experience much smoother.

So now I will start throwing darts into this site!
