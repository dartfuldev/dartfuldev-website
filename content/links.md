This is where I share useful links on Dart. Though there is an [Awesome Dart](https://github.com/yissachar/awesome-dart), I would put some that helped me in here.

* Dart has a really good [documentation](https://dart.dev/guides). I mostly learned from there.

* [Creative Brackets](https://creativebracket.com/) has some good videos on Dart, Aqueduct, AngularDart and Flutter.

* [Dart and Flutter: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-and-flutter-the-complete-developers-guide/) by Stephen Grider, though a Flutter focused course, explains Dart quite nicely.

I promise this link list will grow, for now I am focusing on places you can learn from. I will put up helpful repositories, Twitter accounts to follow, and articles and essays over the course of time. Also, keep an eye on my Twitter handle ([@DartfulDev](https://twitter.com/dartfuldev)) and [Github account](https://github.com/dartfuldev) for shares and snippets. They are both empty (or almost empty) now though.
