      <description>This is where I share useful links on Dart. Though there is an Awesome Dart, I would put some that helped me in here.
 Dart has a really good documentation. I mostly learned from there.
 Creative Brackets has some good videos on Dart, Aqueduct, AngularDart and Flutter.
 Dart and Flutter: The Complete Developer&amp;rsquo;s Guide by Stephen Grider, though a Flutter focused course, explains Dart quite nicely.
  I promise this link list will grow, for now I am focusing on places you can learn from.</description>

      <description>I decided to start Dart last year, not through Flutter, but through AngularDart. While I did not end up selecting AngularDart for the project, I fell in love with the language, and decided to learn it more and use it; I never looked back.
I do not use Dart at my day job, I wish I did, but I don&amp;rsquo;t. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from using it. Flutter may have boosted Dart&amp;rsquo;s popularity recently but it by no means is limited to it, it can be more.</description>
