    <p>This is where I share useful links on Dart. Though there is an <a href="https://github.com/yissachar/awesome-dart">Awesome Dart</a>, I would put some that helped me in here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dart has a really good <a href="https://dart.dev/guides">documentation</a>. I mostly learned from there.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://creativebracket.com/">Creative Brackets</a> has some good videos on Dart, Aqueduct, AngularDart and Flutter.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>I promise this link list will grow, for now I am focusing on places you can learn from. I will put up helpful repositories, Twitter accounts to follow, and articles and essays over the course of time. Also, keep an eye on my Twitter handle (<a href="https://twitter.com/dartfuldev">@DartfulDev</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/dartfuldev">Github account</a> for shares and snippets. They are both empty (or almost empty) now though.</p>
