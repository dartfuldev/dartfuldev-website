    <p>I decided to start Dart last year, not through Flutter, but through AngularDart. While I did not end up selecting AngularDart for the project, I fell in love with the language, and decided to learn it more and use it; I never looked back.</p>

<p>I do not use Dart at my day job, I wish I did, but I don&rsquo;t. But that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from using it. Flutter may have boosted Dart&rsquo;s popularity recently but it by no means is limited to it, it can be more. It can be a very educational first programming language, it can be a very fun full-stack language, it can be a language to implement algorithms or solving programming challenges. I intend to log my efforts in all these in here.</p>

<p>My knowledge is by no means authoritative. I just wish to share whatever I gather in my day to day Dartfulness with a hope that someone corrects my ways. There are numerous sites, blogs or tutorials dedicated to Flutter, but not enough dedicated solely to Dart (Even less so in case of AngularDart). <code>dartful.dev</code> would be an attempt to fill those gaps, even if by very little.</p>

<p>So what do I plan to write here? First and foremost, this site focuses on mainly &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; Dart and occasionally AngularDart. I would explore various areas of programming from a Dartistic point of view, it may seem random but will manage <code>tags</code> so that they can be categorized and read in sequence. I have not figured any solid layout yet but from top of my head, I would write about <em>general programming concepts</em>, <em>algorithms and data structure</em> implementations, <em>design patterns</em> and <em>full-stack web development</em>. I don&rsquo;t think there will be many (if any) Flutter materials here, but I believe a solid knowledge of Dart makes the Flutter experience much smoother.</p>

<p>So now I will start throwing darts into this site!</p>
