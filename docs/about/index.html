    <p>I stumbled upon Dart last year, no, not through Flutter, but though AngularDart. While I did not end up selecting AngularDart for the project, I fell in love with the language, and decided to learn it and use it; I never looked back.</p>

<p>I do not use Dart in my day to day job, I wish I did, but I don&rsquo;t. But that does not stop me from using it. Flutter may have boosted Dart&rsquo;s popularity recently but it by no means is limited to it, it can be more. It can be a very educational first programming language, it can be a very fun full-stack language, it can be a language to implement algorithms or solving programming challenges. I intend to log all my efforts in all those things into this site.</p>

<p>My knowledge is by no means authoritative. I just wish to share whatever I gather in my day to day Dartfulness with a hope that someone corrects my ways. There are numerous sites, blogs or tutorials dedicated to Flutter, but not enough dedicated solely on Dart (Even less so on AngularDart). <code>dartful.dev</code> would be an attempt to fill that that gap, even if by very little.</p>

<p>So what do I plan to write here? First and foremost, this site focuses on &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; Dart. I would explore various areas of programming from a Dartistic point of view, it may seem random but will manage <code>tags</code> so that they can be categorized and read in sequence. I have not figured anything solid out yet but from top of my head, I would write about general programming concepts, algorithms and data structure implementations, design patterns and full-stack web development. I don&rsquo;t think there will be many (if any) Flutter materials here, but I believe a solid knowledge of Dart makes the Flutter experience much smoother.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Google&rsquo;s Dart Team and the contributors for constructing such a simple yet pragmatic language, and the Dart community for staying with it and enriching it through its highs and lows. I would like to thank them all and if this site ever helps anyone in anything, all credits will go to them.</p>

<p>So now that the introduction has been made, I am going to throw a lot of Darts in this site and I know I&rsquo;ll enjoy the journey.</p>
